Description: Netconf configuration script, YANG models and documentation
 The Netconf protocol and YANG modeling language provide a framework
 for the exchange of management information between agents (servers)
 and clients.
 .
 This package includes netconf-config scripts, documentation and YANG
 models for the netconf an YANG libraries, agents and
 applications. YANG models contain a formal description of the data that can be
 managed using netconf and applications.
